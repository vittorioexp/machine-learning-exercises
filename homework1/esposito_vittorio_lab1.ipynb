    "# Data Normalization\n",
    "It is common practice in Statistics and Machine Learning to scale the data (= each variable) so that it is centered (zero mean) and has standard deviation equal to 1. This helps in terms of numerical conditioning of the (inverse) problems of estimating the model (the coefficients of the linear regression in this case), as well as to give the same scale to all the coefficients."
